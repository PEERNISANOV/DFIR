## DFIR Content! ðŸ”Ž  
Welcome to my DFIR repository!  

Here, I share knowledge and insights gathered from real-world Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) investigations.  
This repository contains forensic artifacts, tools, methodologies, and case studiesâ€”all shaped by hands-on experience in the field.  
Whether you're a professional, student, or enthusiast, you'll find valuable resources that bridge the gap between theory and practice.  

Stay curious, stay sharp, and keep investigating!
